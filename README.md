DeMorgan's Complaint System

In our time at Ashesi, we have noticed that whenver a student has a complaint concerning a proble, the student usually has to go to adminstration to report their complaint. After reporting the complaint, the student has no was of knowing when their complaint will be answered unless they go back to the office. We though this is an inefficient way to report the problem and hence we came up with with DeMorgan's Complaint Sytem to solve this problem.

With out system, student's will be able to log in and send their complaint to any department from their current location. When sending a complaint, the student would be able to select the department to receive the complaint and also the category of the department. The complaint would then be send to deparment office for a response

Our System makes use of 8 classes each with its own function
